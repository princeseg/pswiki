  Welcome to PSWiki ‚Äì A Living Technical Documentation
</h2>
![u2.jpeg](/ubuntu-images/u2.jpeg)
In the ever-evolving world of IT, knowledge is fluid‚Äîwhat works today might be obsolete tomorrow. I often find myself retracing steps, trying to recall how I configured a specific setup or resolved a tricky issue. Sound familiar? We‚Äôve all spent far too much time trying to reconstruct past configurations instead of focusing on innovation.

That‚Äôs where ***PSWiki*** comes in‚Äîa dedicated documentation hub designed to serve as my technical reference, ensuring that no project, solution, or troubleshooting insight is lost to memory gaps.

### Why Not Just Use GitHub?

You might be wondering, *"Why not store everything in GitHub?"*‚Äîand that‚Äôs a fair question. But where‚Äôs the excitement in that?¬†For me, ***"building** **_PSWiki_** **itself has been a project‚Äù***‚Äîone that has deepened my understanding of **troubleshooting** [**Ubuntu servers**](/proxmox/ubuntu)**, managing** [**Docker**](/wiki) **containers, and configuring** [**Nginx Proxy Manager**](/wiki). It‚Äôs more than just a reference; it‚Äôs a learning journey in motion.

### **How You Can Get Involved**

As you explore the various projects documented here, I encourage you to **critique the processes**, **suggest improvements**, and **engage in discussions** on how I can refine my configurations. Efficiency and knowledge expansion are always the goals! If you're passionate about IT and eager to collaborate, **let‚Äôs** [**connect**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prince-e-segbefia/) **and build something great together**.

### **The Importance of Documentation**

In any technical environment‚Äîwhether managing IT infrastructure, troubleshooting networking issues, or deploying containerized applications‚Äîdocumentation is a **critical foundation for success**. It ensures clarity, efficiency, and reliability, preventing knowledge gaps that can lead to costly errors.

### **Why Documentation Matters**

**Preserves Institutional Knowledge**

-   Captures configurations, workflows, and troubleshooting steps so no critical information is lost over time.
-   Helps teams onboard faster without relying on verbal knowledge transfer.

**Boosts Efficiency & Reduces Errors**

-   Well-documented processes eliminate guesswork, reducing troubleshooting time.
-   Saves hours by providing ready-to-use guides rather than repetitive manual research.

**Supports Scalability & Growth**

-   Ensures smooth transitions when upgrading systems or expanding infrastructure.
-   Allows teams to build upon existing setups without unnecessary duplication of work.
