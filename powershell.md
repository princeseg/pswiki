# Project Synopsis{synopsis}
âœ… Purpose: Automate the setup of a fresh Windows Server installation with predefined configurations, removing the need for manual GUI setup. âœ… Scope: Includes user creation, role assignments, network settings, firewall rules, software installations, and security policies.

Why GUI Wonâ€™t Work?
ðŸš« No direct way to apply bulk configurations via GUIâ€”requires running PowerShell scripts to automate installations & policies. ðŸš« Batch automation for multiple serversâ€”PowerShell can deploy identical configurations across many servers, which the GUI would require manual repetition.

Key Features to Automate
âœ” User & Group Management: Create admin accounts, set permissions. âœ” Network Configuration: Assign static IP, DNS settings. âœ” Firewall Rules: Apply security policies & port rules. âœ” Software Deployment: Install tools like Docker, IIS, or SQL Server via scripts. âœ” Task Scheduling: Set up automated backups & system updates.

This is a powerful project that will save time, reduce manual errors, and ensure consistency across deployments. ðŸš€ Let me know if you'd like a sample script to get started!
